This is my initial thoughts at how this should look for the user. This was done with Craig's additions in mind. This is completely a prototype so if anything needs changes or if something seems off feel free to let me know or to change it in the repo.

I am currently in the process of implementing the authentication/login into the feature where the user will have to be logged into a google account to access the website(Google was used as Craig advised most schools are using Chromebooks which they will all have Gmail accounts.). This is being done by Firebase which is not yet implement into the example repo. Once I work out some kinks in the code I will push that into here but it seems to be a good working system so far and will allow us to use protected routes within our Frontend for students and teachers to access. Firebase uses Googles authentication and uses their uniqueIDs so we can use that to ensure the correct user is where they are supposed to be. Firebase also has a fairly simple database to use and I plan using that for the chat function between the student and teacher.
